I wanted to refresh myself during the consecutive holidays, so I went to Komine Park and Kongo Falls in Akiruno City. I chose this place because (1) compared to Mt. Takao, it is relatively less well-known and less crowded, (2) there is an electric substation nearby, so I could witness the harmony of environment and energy, and (3) it is a moderate distance from my apartment. (3) because it was a good distance from my apartment, but accessible by train.

## Access
I think this was the first time I came this far west in Tokyo. It took about 1.5 hours from Shimokitazawa to Kichijoji ⇒ Mitaka ⇒ Tachikawa ⇒ Haijima ⇒ Musashi Itsukaichi. The Chuo Line was so crowded that I could not sit down because of the consecutive holidays, but I could afford to sit on the Itsukaichi Line. Musashi Itsukaichi Station is a single-track line, but it is electrified, and my first impression of the station is that it looks like a rural area, but it is surprisingly urban.

## Komine Park
The distance from the station to the park was plainly long.
